# Database
## Server: Mysql
As per the project requirement we are using Mysql Server as our datasource.

## Setup
- To simulate production and development environment it is required to have a common remote database server as production database and local/remote database as development database.
- For this we are using a free remote mysql server provided by www.remotemysql.com.
